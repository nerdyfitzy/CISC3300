1. Escaping data is using escape characters to defend against malicious code injection attacks.
   It is often done by putting a \ to prevent a language interpreting certain characters (such as ")
   incorrectly.

2. A RESTful API is one which the client and the server are implemented independently.
   Both the client and server can be changed and modified without affecting the other whatsoever.
   Statelessness is a key component of RESTful APIs, and it refers to both the client and server
   being able to interpret any message sent between the two regardless of the state either are in.
   A resource is a general word for a "thing" sent through the internet, whether that be an "image, document, or object"

3. A cookie is a part of the document usually assigned by the server. They are often used
   to track usage by a certain browser, and allow for a server to discern between different clients.

4. A session is what a server uses to track a given user. When a new user enters a website,
   the server returns a "session" to discern that specific user.
