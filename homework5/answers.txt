4. The DOM (document object model) is a tree of the entire page, including 
   all elements, styles, attributes, events, and etc. It allows JS to interact with
   and change any given aspect of a page through an object structure.

5. XSS (cross-site scripting) attacks are carried out by someone attempting to execute
   outside code on a website, often through direct user input encased
   in <script> tags that will be embedded in innerHTML. User input should never be trusted and
   should always be sanitized to prevent any input from being ran as direct HTML.
