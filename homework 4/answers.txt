1. Javascript is a scripting language ran in browsers that allows
   for more interactive web pages. An interpreted language does not
   check variable types and reassignments before runtime, and therefore
   allows for more dynamic memory reassignment at runtime.

2. const declares a constant, unchangable variable in the local scope
   var declares a mutable variable at the global scope and is largely unused in current JS 
   let declares a mutable variable at the local scope and is the best practice for defining mutable variables

3. An anonymous function in javascript is a function used as an argument for another funcion, they often act as callbacks
   to mimic synchronus tasks in the language.
   A higher order function is a function that takes functions as parameters or returns another function.

4. Javascript objects are just key value pairs instead of OOP objects that are a collection of member variables and functions.
