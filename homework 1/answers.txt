1. The URL routes the user to a DNS (domain name system) server through the user's ISP (internet service provider).
   The DNS server then gives the IP to the user's browser,
   which allows the user to communicate with the server (and website) in its entirety.
2. HTML (hypertext markup language) is a language used for creating webpages.
   It is chiefly concerned with the structural design of the page, only consisting of elements
   that have certain attributes and uses.
3. The page has a list of menu items on the top, showing that they are core tools to
   using the website and can help navigation. Additionally, the top left has a Fordham
   logo to show the user where they are, and the blocking of the site shows separate main events
   taking place within the school.
4. An HTML element is what every HTML page is comprised of, it is denoted by <> signs with a name inside and has a specific
   purpose and usage related to SEO, user interaction, or organization. 
   A tag is the <> with the name inside that denotes what the element is, and the attributes are certain
   values assigned to a certain element (src for an img element or, more generally, the id and class attributes).
