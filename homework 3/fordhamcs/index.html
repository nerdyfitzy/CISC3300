            Wherever there’s a computer, there’s a skilled person developing,
            maintaining, hacking, advancing or simply using it. Be that person.

              It’s difficult to imagine life without computers when they’re so
              central to our information-driven global society. But it’s not
              difficult to imagine the amazing pursuits you’ll be prepared for
              with a degree in computer science from Fordham’s department of
              Computer and Information Sciences.

              The computer science major emphasizes science and technology,
              including software design and programming, computer architecture
              and functions, and the development of an ability to analyze and
              solve problems in using the computer as a tool.

              You’ll learn more than computer science here. You’ll also study
              philosophy, theology, history, mathematics, languages, and the
              performing arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the
              centerpiece of our liberal arts education. We want you to excel in
              your field—and as a human being.
