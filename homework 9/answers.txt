1. SQL is a database system based on the relational database model.
   Each database contains a collection of tables which can reference each other
   and interact with each other in order to create relations between data.

4. A PHP PDO is a built in way of accessing and interacting with databases
   through the language. Prepared statements are necessary to avoid SQL injection
   attacks where a user inputting data could input an SQL statement that could access
   or mutate sensitive user data.
